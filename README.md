# QAP-4-JC
This repository contains two python programs - totalsalesgraph.py and onestopinsurancecompany.py
as well as the defaults file (OSICDef.dat) and policies file (Policies.dat) for the One Stop
Insurance Company program.
The totalsalesgraph.py program will generate a graph based on user inputs for the total sales of
each month. matplotlib is a required library for this program and will need to be installed.
(import matplotlib.pyplot as plt)
The onestopinsurancecompany.py program will enter and calculate new insurance policy information
for OSIC customers. This program uses the libraries datetime (import datetime) (from datetime import
timedelta), time (import time), tqdm (from tqdm import tqdm) and the format values (import
FormatValues as FV). The datetime and time libraries are already installed on pycharm if you decide
to run this code with pycharm and the tqdm requires installation. The format values file is
included in this repository and will be required to download to properly format values in the OSIC
program.
